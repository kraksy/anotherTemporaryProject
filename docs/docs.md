rat likes cheese , rat eats cheese, rat fucking hate keys

## what about ?

- genres:   roguelike, adventure , rpg
- complete simple dungeons floors to get cheese



# wltd 

- [] generate a map with enemies 




















## map ?

- put room into random place
- rooms cant overlap
- rooms will connect with path
- on start and end of path place 
- assign keys to doors where there is only way in but no way out

## enemies ?

- define max and min enemies in room
- check what floors so you can set difficulty
- assign room
- place into the assigned room randomly

## combat ?

- would be cool if you touch enemy , it would open up like jrpg style combat
- BIG MINUS : lot of ascii art needed , also GUI
